# Project Name

## Description
A full-stack web application with a Node.js backend and a frontend powered by React.js. This project allows users to send interest messages, accept or reject them, and engage in real-time chat.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (optional, but recommended for development)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the backend server using `nodemon` (or `node` if you don't have `nodemon` installed):

```bash
nodemon server.js
```

This command will start the backend server and automatically restart it on changes to the code. If you don't have `nodemon`, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or another port if specified in `server.js`).

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the frontend application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server and open the app in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set up any necessary environment variables for both the frontend and backend. This could include database credentials, API keys, or port numbers. Refer to the `.env.example` files in both the backend and frontend directories for required variables.
